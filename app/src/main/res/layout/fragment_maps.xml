 * @description: The purpose of this app is to  implement a traveling log app.
 * This app is specific to users who want to make traveling their hobby and
 * create a fun way to save travel memories. In order to do that, the user
 * will be able to keep track of places they have been around the world,
 * add pictures of those places to save memories, add contacts to the app
 * to share stuff with other people, and make reflective notes. The application
 * will have multiple screens, buttons, texts, and images, all of which follow
 * a specific style. This program does this by incorporating the use of fragments
 * and activities. The GoogleMaps API is used to display the locations the user
 * pins as well as the locations of the photos and notes taken. In addition,
 * the Wikipedia API is used to display a webpage if the user clicks on a
 * location in the list. The data is contained in ArrayLists which makes
 * it applicable to store in text files (.txt) using internal storage. Content
 * providers are used in order to gather the contacts data for sharing. Explicit
 * intents are used for sending emails, SMS messages and taking photos. In this
 * fragment_maps is where the full map screen is displayed here.
